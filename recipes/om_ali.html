<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Historically speaking, Om Ali has an interesting legend behind it. This Egyptian dessert is said (although just one of several stories) to be named after the first wife of Sultan Ezz El Din Aybek, in celebration of the death of Shajar Al-Durr (the sultan’s second wife). The second wife plotted and carried out the murder of the sultan and was subsequently killed herself. To celebrate her death, his first wife (known as Om Ali) asked the chefs to create a delicious dessert, which was distributed among the local people and became popular throughout the country.</p>
    <p>What actually is it, though? Om Ali is known under several names, including Om Ali, um Ali, umm Ali, oumm Ali, and omali (meaning “Mother of Ali”). It refers to an Egyptian “bread pudding” traditionally made with pastry (or bread), pistachios, raisins, coconut flakes/shreds, and a sweet milk (and often cream) mixture. After assembling, the Egyptian dessert is baked until golden brown. It’s similar to British “bread pudding,” but with no eggs, meaning it’s lighter and looser (not “set”) in texture rather than thick and custardy.</p>
