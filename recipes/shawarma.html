        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is my most favorite recipe for my most favorite food ever and one of my signature recipes that will be very familiar to all my friends because I make this so often. It is off the charts for effort vs output: just a handful of everyday spices, garlic, a splash of lemon and olive oil transforms into the most incredible flavour.</p>
            <p>Shawarma is a popular dish originating from the Middle East. It’s a popular street food that is traditionally made in the form of spiced meats that are stacked on a vertical rotisserie with thin slices shaved off as it rotates. But don’t worry! We can cook our horizontally in a good old pan or on the BBQ!</p>
